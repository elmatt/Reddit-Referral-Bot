# Reddit-Referral-Bot
Bot scans for referral links to post my referral codes

The idea of the bot is simple. In The subreddit "Churning", there used to be referral links posted every month for specific credit card links. The bot would post these links at random times. I created this bot to run every minute on Google App Engine. My bot would look at the newest posts on "Churning" and find if a referral link was posted. It would post my referral link to the thread. This bot allowed my post to be visible immediately for anyone that needed a link, and allowed me to not constantly scan and see if a new thread was posted for a referral link.

The "Churning" subreddit unfortunately ended their referral link program, so I am now posting the code here. I ended up gaining the following referral gains from this bot:

100,000 Ultimate Rewards points from the Chase Ink Preferred ($1500 value)
60,000 Marriott points from Marriot Premier and SPG ($300 value)
40,000 Southwest points from Southwest Premier and Plus ($400 value)
20,000 Ultimate Rewards points from Chase Sapphire Preferred ($300 value)
20,000 United Points from Chase United Explorer ($150 value)

Not bad.
